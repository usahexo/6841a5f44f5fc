#  Quebec set to follow Ontario in increasing legal betting age

Quebec is set to follow in Ontario's footsteps by increasing the legal betting age from 18 to 21. This move comes as Quebec looks to bolster its efforts in tackling problem gambling.

Ontario made the change in September, and it will come into effect in Quebec on January 1st, 2019. Both provinces are hoping that by raising the legal age for gambling, they will be able to better protect those who are most vulnerable to developing a gambling addiction.

The Canadian Gaming Association (CGA) has come out in support of the move, with President and CEO Serge Rainville stating that "the CGA supports responsible policies that help to protect individuals from developing a gambling problem. We applaud Quebec for taking this important step."

Quebec is not the only province looking at increasing the legal betting age. In Nova Scotia, a bill was introduced last year that would raise the legal age from 19 to 21. And in British Columbia, work is currently underway on a strategy to tackle problem gambling, with one possible measure being an increase in the legal betting age.

For problem gamblers, the increased age limit can provide some much-needed relief. "It's good news," said John Whyte, Director of Problem Gambling Services at CAMH. "For people who are struggling with their gambling behaviour, it means one less place where they can gamble."

Research has shown that people under the age of 21 are more likely to develop a gambling addiction than those over 21. This is largely because younger people are more likely to be impulsive and less likely to think through the consequences of their actions.

"It's really important that we delay access to gambling for young people," said Whyte. "That way we can hopefully prevent them from developing a problem down the road."

#  Quebec one step closer to raising legal betting age

The province of Quebec is one step closer to raising the legal betting age from 18 to 21. On Tuesday, the provincial government announced that it would be introducing a bill in the coming days that would make this change.

If the bill passes, Quebec will be the first jurisdiction in North America to have a legal betting age of 21. The only other country with a higher legal betting age is Australia, where it is set at 25.

The change in policy is an attempt by the Quebec government to address problem gambling among young people. According to reports, about one-third of all problem gamblers in Quebec are under the age of 21.

Critics of the proposed bill argue that it could push young people towards unregulated and illegal forms of gambling. However, supporters say that it will help protect vulnerable young people from developing gambling addictions.

Regardless of which side you fall on, it’s clear that this is a contentious issue that will continue to be debated in Quebec and beyond.

#  Bill proposing increase to legal betting age moves forward in Quebec National Assembly

 MONTREAL, Quebec - A controversial bill that would see the legal betting age increase from 18 to 21 has passed its first reading in the National Assembly of Quebec.

The proposed legislation, tabled by MNA Martine Ouellet of the separatist Bloc Québécois, would make it illegal for anyone under 21 to place a bet at Quebec's licensed sports venues and online gambling platforms.

"We are very proud to have brought this important bill before the National Assembly," said Ouellet in a statement to the press. "It is essential that we do everything possible to protect our young people from the dangers of gambling addiction."

Opponents of the bill argue that it will only push gambling activity underground, where it will be more difficult to regulate and monitor. Some also suggest that it will unfairly penalize young adults who are legally allowed to vote and serve in the military but not gamble.

Reaction among Quebec's political parties has been mixed. The governing Liberal Party has expressed tentative support for the bill, while both the Parti Québécois and Coalition Avenir Québec have come out against it.

If passed, the bill would come into effect on January 1, 2020.

#  Quebec proposal to increase legal betting age advances

Quebec's finance minister has proposed increasing the legal gambling age from 18 to 21, in a move that would bring the province in line with other jurisdictions in Canada.

The proposal was made on Thursday, as part of the government's efforts to address a $2-billion budget shortfall. If it is approved, the new betting age would come into effect next year.

 Ontario and British Columbia are among the other provinces that have a legal gambling age of 19. In Alberta and Manitoba, the age is 18.

Public consultations on the proposal will be held over the next few months.

A study published last year by Quebec's casino regulator found that almost 60 per cent of people who gamble start before they turn 18. The average losing gambler spends $1,500 a year, or 3.5 per cent of their income, on bets.

According to Finance Minister Eric Girard, increasing the legal age would help protect young people from addiction and social problems related to gambling. "It's important to protect our young people... It's a public health issue," he said at a news conference on Thursday.

Opposition parties in Quebec have so far been supportive of the proposal. "I think it's a step in the right direction," said Parti Quebecois member Sol Zanetti, who is also vice-chair of the legislature's committee on finance and economic affairs. "The younger you are when you start gambling, the more at risk you are."

#  Quebec lawmakers debate bill to increase legal betting age

MONTREAL - Quebec lawmakers are debating a bill that would increase the legal betting age from 18 to 21.

The proposed legislation would also prohibit anyone younger than 21 from entering a casino or gaming arcade.

Supporters of the bill say it is necessary to protect young people from the harmful effects of gambling.

Opponents argue that adults should have the right to make their own decisions about whether or not to gamble.

So far, there has been no word on when the legislature will vote on the bill.
