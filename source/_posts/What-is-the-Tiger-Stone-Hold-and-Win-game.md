#  What is the Tiger Stone Hold and Win game?

The Tiger Stone Hold and Win game is a strategy game that is played with three tigers and one stone. The object of the game is to capture the stone by holding it between two tigers.

To begin, divide the players into two teams, with each team having one tiger. The tigers stand at opposite ends of the playing area, which should be at least 6 feet long. Place the stone in the middle of the playing area.

The first player on each team starts by trying to grab the stone with their tiger. If they are successful, they keep hold of the stone and their team's other tiger tries to grab it from them. If they are not successful, their team's other tiger tries to grab the stone from them. The winner is the team that grabs the stone and holds onto it for three consecutive rounds.
