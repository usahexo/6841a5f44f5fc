#  What are the New York Knicks?

The New York Knicks are a professional basketball team based in the borough of Manhattan in New York City. The Knicks compete in the National Basketball Association (NBA) as a member of the Atlantic Division of the Eastern Conference.

The team was established in 1946 as the Basketball Association of America (BAA) and joined the NBA at its inception in 1949. The Knicks played their home games at Madison Square Garden from 1968 to 2017, when they moved to their current home at Madison Square Garden III.

The Knicks hold the record for the most wins and the second-most playoff appearances in NBA history.[4] The Knicks were successful during their early years, winning two championships in three years (1951 and 1952), and appearing in five consecutive NBA Finals (1949–1953). However, they have been largely unsuccessful since then, with one playoff appearance in the past 17 years.

# Origins

The New York Knickerbockers organization was founded in 1946 by Ned Irish, a former promoter of amateur basketball events. Irish was an early investor in the Harlem Globetrotters exhibition team, which toured throughout North America playing against local teams. He also sought to establish a basketball league that would be attended by fans of all races. Tammany Hall leader Carmine DeSapio became involved as an advisor to the team, but later resigned due to bribery allegations.[5] In 1947, the BAA merged with two other leagues to form the National Basketball Association (NBA).

The Knicks were one of 11 original NBA teams, and they were coached by Red Holzman from 1967 to 1982. Under Holzman, led by star center Willis Reed, forward Walt Frazier and point guard Earl Monroe, they won two championships (in 1970 and 1973), appeared in five straight NBA Finals (from 1969 to 1973), made it to eight consecutive playoff semifinals (1968–1975) and recorded ten consecutive 50-win seasons. In 1969–1970 season, Knick players Dave DeBusschere, Bill Bradley and Walt Frazier were selected for the All-Star Game; Kenny Walker later became the first Knick rookie selected to play in 1992–1993 season game. Holzman was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame as a coach in 1998. After coaching for another year, Holzman retired but remained with the organization as general manager until 1978.

In 1984, Lawrence Tanter replaced Holzman as head coach; however he only lasted one year and was replaced by Rick Pitino who coached for two years before being fired after his involvement with prostitutes came to light.[6][7] Jeff Van Gundy then took over as head coach from 1991 to 2001. He led the team to six playoff appearances including an appearance in 1999 Eastern Conference Finals where they lost 4 games to 1 against Shaquille O'Neal's Orlando Magic; during this time period Patrick Ewing served as player/coach on multiple occasions including during 1996 playoffs. Van Gundy then left coaching after being fired by owner James Dolan midway through 2001-2002 season but continued working as a commentator on TV broadcasts.[8] Don Chaney was then promoted from assistant coach to head coach for 2002-2004 season but was fired after leading them to 33 wins and 65 losses—the worst record ever for an NBA Head Coach after 1 full season or more games coached.[9]Following Chaney's firing Lenny Wilkens who had previously been hired as a consultant took over coaching duties for 2004–2005 season,[10] but only lasted until February 2005 when he retired from coaching; he however stayed with Knicks organization serving first as special assistant for player development before assuming title of Senior Advisor For Player Development.[11] Herb Williams took over for 2005–2008 season,[12] followed by Mike D'Antoni for 2008–2012 seasons who achieved greater success leading them to 3 consecutive playoff appearances including 2nd round defeat against eventual champions Miami Heat twice;[13][14][15][16]D'Antoni resigned from his position on March 14th 2012 due to health reasons .[17][18][19][20] On May 8th 2012 Glen Grunwald was promoted from assistant general manager to president of basketball operations while retaining his previous position; this effectively ended his role as interim general manager which he had taken on following Donnie Walsh's resignation earlier that year.[21][22] On June 24th 2012 new head coach Mike Woodson was introduced.[23][24][25].Woodson would go onto lead them back into playoffs achieving 2nd round victories against Boston Celtics[26],[27], Atlanta Hawks[28],[29], Indiana Pacers[30],[31]; unfortunately they were eventually defeated 4 games to 2 against LeBron James' Miami Heat throughout Eastern Conference Semifinals during 2012-2013 postseason . 

# Notable players

Throughout its history, the Knicks have had several notable players including:

#  What is Caesar?

Caesar is a cipher, or code, that uses the Caesar Shift to encrypt text. The Caesar Shift is a common substitution cipher where each letter in the text is replaced by a letter some number of places down the alphabet. For example, if the shift is 3, A would be replaced by D, B would become E, and so on.

The Caesar cipher has been used for centuries to keep information safe from prying eyes. It is still in use today, although it is not as popular as it once was.

# How does Caesar work?

The Caesar cipher works by shifting each letter in the text three places down the alphabet. So, if you have the text "Hello world", the encrypted text would be "Hyae wlrld".

# How can I use Caesar?

To use Caesar, you first need to choose a shift value. This is the number of places down the alphabet that each letter will be replaced. You can choose any value you want, but 3 is a common choice.

Next, you need to type your text into a text editor or word processor. Make sure that all of your letters are lowercase and there are no spaces between them. Then, select the entire text and apply the Caesar Shift using your chosen value.

For example, if your shift value is 3 and your text is "My name is John", the encrypted text would be "Rjyn iaS pihg".



You can also use an online tool to encrypt your text with the Caesar cipher. One such tool is available at https://www.ciphertools.com/caesar-cipher/.
