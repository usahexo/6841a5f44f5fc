#  Police Raid Illegal Gambling Den in Chinatown

On the morning of Wednesday, October 3, the police descended on an illegal gambling den in Chinatown. The raid was part of a coordinated effort between the New York Police Department and the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

According to authorities, the gambling den had been in operation for several years and was believed to have generated millions of dollars in revenue. The building where it was located had been under surveillance for some time, and officials were confident that they had enough evidence to make a case against the operators.

The raid went smoothly, and no one was injured. Several people were taken into custody and are expected to be charged with gambling offences.

This is not the first time that the NYPD has targeted an illegal gambling operation in Chinatown. In fact, crackdowns on these types of establishments have become increasingly common in recent years. This is likely due to the fact that gambling is a major source of revenue for criminal organizations in Chinatown.

The NYPD is committed to eradicating all forms of illegal gambling in New York City, and we will continue to work with our partners at the FBI to dismantle these operations.

Police Lt. Dean Milner said the arrests were a success in that they broke up two major gambling operations in the city. He urged anyone with information about illegal gambling to come forward and help the police department shut down such operations.

The arrested men and women were all released after being given misdemeanor citations for unlawful gambling.
