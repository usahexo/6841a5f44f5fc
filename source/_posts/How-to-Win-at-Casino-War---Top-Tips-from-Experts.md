#  How to Play Casino War for Fun and Profit

There’s no need to trek down to a brick-and-mortar casino when you want to play casino games. In fact, there are plenty of great casino games you can play from the comfort of your own home, and casino war is one of them. This game is easy to learn, but surprisingly complex and has the potential for big payouts.

What is Casino War?

Casino war is a card game that simulates a battle between two armies. The object of the game is to win as many cards as possible until you run out, thereby making your opponent “surrender.” The game is played with a deck of 52 cards, and each player is dealt two cards face up. The player with the higher value card wins the battle, and the loser must surrender one card to the winner. If both cards are equal in value, then a new battle takes place. The first player to lose all their cards (or who surrenders) loses the game.

How To Play Casino War:

1) Decide how many hands you want to play. 
2) Shuffle and deal out two cards face up for each hand. 
3) Compare the values of the two cards - the highest value card wins the battle. 
4) If one player has no more cards, that player loses the hand - even if they have a higher value card than their opponent. 
5) The winner of each hand collects one card from their opponent. 
6) The first player to lose all their cards (or who surrenders), loses the game.

#  How do You Perform Casino War Microgaming? 

Microgaming is one of the leading casino game developers in the world. They have a wide range of casino games in their portfolio, from classic table games to cutting-edge video slots. One of their most popular games is Casino War.

 Casino War is a simple, fast-paced card game that can be played by any player, regardless of experience or skill level. The objective of the game is to beat your opponent's hand by either having a higher rank than them, or by forcing them to fold.

To start a game of Casino War, each player is dealt two cards face down. The rank of these cards is then revealed, and the player with the highest ranking card wins the pot. If both players have the same rank card, the pot is split equally between them. If one player has a rank card and the other has a trump card (an Ace, King, Queen or Jack), then the trump card wins the pot automatically.

If neither player has a rank card (or if both players have trump cards), then the player with the highest value card wins the pot. If both players have equal value cards, then it's a draw and no money changes hands.

The game can be played for real money or for fun credits. Wagering begins with 1 credit and goes up in increments of 1 credit until it reaches 10 credits. After that, players must wager multiples of 10 credits at a time.

#  How well do you know the rules of casino war? 

Casino war is a relatively simple game that can be learned quickly. However, there are a few rules that you need to be aware of in order to play the game correctly and get the most out of it. 

The aim of casino war is to beat the dealer by having a higher card than them. If you and the dealer have the same card, the hand is a ‘push’ and you get your money back. If you lose, you lose your bet. 

In order to win, you need to first place a bet. The minimum bet is usually $1, but it can vary depending on the casino. After placing your bet, you will then be dealt two cards face up. The dealer will also be dealt two cards, but one will be face down. 

If your two cards are higher than the dealer’s two cards, you win even money on your bet plus an additional amount equal to your original bet. For example, if you have an ace and a two and the dealer has a four and a five, you would win $3 (two for having a higher card than the dealer, one for winning even money on your bet). 

If your two cards are lower than the dealer’s two cards or either card matches the dealer’s hidden card, you lose your original bet amount. 

There is also a bonus payout available when playing casino war if you manage to get a ‘war’ with the dealer. A war occurs when both players have equal ranked cards (for example two sixes). In this case, each player will be dealt another card face up. The player with the highest value card wins and their opponent loses double their original bet amount.
