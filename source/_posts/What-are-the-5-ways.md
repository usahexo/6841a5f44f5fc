#  What are the 5 ways?

In the world of business, there are five ways to make money. The five ways are product, service, franchise, royalties and residual income.

The first way is through product sales. When a company produces a good or service and sells it to consumers, they make a profit on the sale. This is the most common way to make money in business and is how most companies operate.

The second way is through service provision. This involves providing a service to clients in exchange for payment. Services can be provided in person or over the Internet.

The third way to make money is through franchising. Franchising is when a company licenses its brand and business model to another party in order to start a new business. The party who owns the franchise pays a fee to the company for this license and then earns a share of the profits from the new business.

The fourth way to make money is through royalties. A company can earn royalties by licensing its intellectual property to other parties. For example, a music artist might license their songs to a movie studio for use in a film. The studio would then pay the artist a royalty each time the song is played in the film.

The fifth way businesses can make money is through residual income. Residual income is earned when a company collects payments for services provided over an extended period of time. For example, a company that provides Internet service might receive monthly payments from its customers for years after they sign up for the service.
