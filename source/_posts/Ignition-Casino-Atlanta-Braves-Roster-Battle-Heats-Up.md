#  Ignition Casino Atlanta Braves Roster Battle Heats Up

The Atlanta Braves have one of the most competitive roster battles in all of baseball. There are at least 10 players competing for 5 starting spots and numerous backup roles. This article will highlight the top 3 contenders for each spot on the roster.

1. Starting Pitcher: Julio Teheran, Mike Foltynewicz, and Max Fried

Julio Teheran is the clear favorite to win the starting pitcher job. He has been the Braves ace for the past few seasons and is coming off his best season yet. Mike Foltynewicz is looking to build on his breakout season last year. He has the stuff to be an ace, but needs to prove he can stay healthy and pitch deep into games. Max Fried is a young lefty with a lot of potential. He pitched well in limited innings last year and could make a case for being the 5th starter if he pitches well this spring.

2. Second Baseman: Ozzie Albies, Dansby Swanson, and Charlie Culberson

Ozzie Albies had a break-out rookie season last year and is now considered one of the best second baseman in baseball. Dansby Swanson struggled in his first full season last year, but still has potential as a middle-of-the-order hitter. Charlie Culberson proved himself as a valuable utility player last year and will compete for playing time at second base this year.

3. Catcher: Tyler Flowers, Kurt Suzuki, and Alex Jackson

Tyler Flowers was excellent behind the plate last year and provides veteran leadership to Atlanta's young pitching staff. Kurt Suzuki provides depth at catcher and could start if Flowers needs time off or struggles offensively. Alex Jackson was acquired from Seattle in the trade for Jean Segura last year. He has big power potential but needs to improve his batting average if he wants to make an impact at the major league level.

#  Atlanta Braves hope for rebound season with Ignition Casino sponsorship

The Braves hope that the partnership with Ignition will help them rebound in the upcoming season. The team has made several major acquisitions in the offseason, including outfielder Justin Upton and starting pitcher Julio Teheran. Manager Fredi Gonzalez is confident that this year's Braves squad can compete with anyone in the league.

Ignition Casino is excited to be working with such a storied franchise. "We are proud to partner with the Atlanta Braves as they look to regain their former glory," said Ignition spokesperson Robyn Glaser. "We wish them all the best of luck this season."

For its part, Atlanta is counting on Ignition Casino to help energize its fan base. The team expects that the partnership will create some additional excitement around game days at Turner Field. "Our fans are passionate about their Braves, and we're confident that Ignition Casino will add to the excitement and energy at our games," said Atlanta COO Derek Schiller.

Both sides are hopeful that this partnership will be mutually beneficial. The Braves are looking to reclaim their place atop baseball, while Ignition Casino is looking to establish itself as a leading gambling destination. It should be an exciting season ahead for both entities!
