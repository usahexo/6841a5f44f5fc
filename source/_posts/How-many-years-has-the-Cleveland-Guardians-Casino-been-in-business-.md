In 2007, Gilbert made a $10 million donation to his alma mater, Michigan State University, which renamed its business school after him.

Gilbert has been a long-time advocate for revitalizing downtown Detroit and Cleveland. After purchasing the Cavaliers in 2005, he moved the team's headquarters from suburban Independence to downtown Cleveland. He has also made major investments in both cities' real estate markets. In Detroit, Gilbert has purchased more than 100 buildings in an effort to revive the city's downtown core. In Cleveland, he has developed more than 15 million square feet of office and residential space.
