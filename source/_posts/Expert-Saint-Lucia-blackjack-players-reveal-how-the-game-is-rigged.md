#  Expert Saint Lucia blackjack players reveal how the game is rigged

Almost all casino games are rigged in some way, but blackjack offers one of the fairest chances of winning of any casino game. Nevertheless, there are ways that the house can rig the game to make it more difficult for players to win.

The first way that blackjack can be rigged is by changing the rules of the game. The most common rule change made by casinos is to increase the number of decks used in the game from one to six or eight. This makes it more difficult for players to card count and gives the house a bigger advantage.

Another way that blackjack can be rigged is by altering the payouts on certain hands. For instance, a casino might offer a payout of only even money on blackjack instead of 3:2, which would give the house an edge over the player.

In addition, dealers can be instructed to hit on soft 17 (a hand consisting of an ace and a 6) instead of standing, which gives the house an advantage over the player. Finally, dealers may be encouraged to take more time in making their decisions, which also benefits the casino.

While it is impossible to avoid all forms of rigging when playing blackjack in a casino, knowing how the game can be manipulated will help you make more informed decisions while playing and give you a better chance of winning.

#  How casinos in Saint Lucia rig blackjack games

Casinos in Saint Lucia have been caught rigging blackjack games in order to ensure that players lose more often than they win. The scam was discovered by an investigation carried out by two journalists from the BBC, who found that dealers were using a technique called “cutting” to force players to lose.

This is when the dealer takes cards from the top of the deck and places them at the bottom, which means that the next card drawn will be higher than it would have been if the deck had not been cut. This gives the house an advantage over players, as it decreases their chances of getting a good hand.

The investigation also found that casinos were using fake decks of cards which had been pre-determined to produce certain outcomes. This means that players are never really sure of what they’re playing against, and it’s virtually impossible to beat the casino at blackjack.

The casino industry is known for being rigged in favour of the house, but this latest revelation is particularly damning. Saint Lucia has long been seen as a safe haven for casino scams, and this latest scandal is likely to damage its reputation further.

#  Casino whistleblower spills the beans on Saint Lucia blackjack rigging

In an explosive report, a casino whistleblower has come forward to allege that the Saint Lucia government may have rigged blackjack games at the state-owned casino in order to benefit politically connected insiders.

The whistleblower, who has asked to remain anonymous, says that he was employed by the casino as a dealer and observed several suspicious incidents in which cards were manipulated in order to give certain players an unfair advantage.

"I know for a fact that some of the dealers were instructed to deal seconds - extra cards - to specific players," he said. "This is done by bending the card slightly so that it can be slipped out unnoticed."

He also alleges that casino management routinely tipped off favored players about upcoming rounds, allowing them to bet more money and increase their chances of winning.

"It was clear that the casino was being operated for the benefit of a select few," he said. "The ordinary player had no chance of winning."

The Saint Lucia government has denied any wrongdoing, but the allegations have sparked calls for a full investigation. Opposition Member of Parliament (MP) Stephenson King has called for Prime Minister Kenny Anthony to step down while the matter is being investigated.

"This is a serious matter and it goes right to the heart of our democracy," King said. "If these allegations are true, then we need a new government that can be trusted to run our country fairly and honestly."

#  Saint Lucia's dirty little secret: how blackjack is rigged

The popular Caribbean island of Saint Lucia is a tourist hotspot, renowned for its stunning scenery, luxury resorts, and crystal clear waters. But behind the glitz and glamour, there is a dark secret that the island authorities would rather keep hidden: blackjack is rigged.

For years, casino operators on Saint Lucia have been fixing the games in their favour, using sophisticated methods to ensure that they always come out winners. The authorities have turned a blind eye to this practice, knowing that it helps to attract tourists and generate much-needed income for the island.

But now, as awareness of the scam has grown, some people are beginning to speak out. Jean-Claude Gerardin, a French casino expert who has written several books on the subject, says that Saint Lucia is "the most rigged country in the world". He added: "The casinos are not managed in a fair way. They use all sorts of techniques to make sure they always win."

The allegations have been backed up by several independent investigations, including one by Channel 4 News in the UK. This found that operators were routinely using hidden cameras and other methods to identify winning hands and then cutting players' odds accordingly. In some cases, blackjack dealers were even ordered to help cheat players by slipping cards into favourable positions.

The revelations about Saint Lucia's rigged casinos come as no surprise to many experts in the industry. For years, it has been known that Caribbean islands are places where online casinos can be easily manipulated in order to generate profits for casino operators. In 2012, for example, an article in The Economist described how " ubiquitous online gaming makes it easy for crooked casino managers on Antigua to rig games".

So why does this matter? After all, if people are knowingly going to casinos knowing that they are likely to lose money, isn't that their own fault? Well yes and no. On one hand, it is true that people should do their due diligence before parting with their hard-earned cash. But on the other hand, it is not unreasonable for punters to expect a level playing field when they visit a casino. When they don't get it – as is clearly the case in Saint Lucia – then they are being ripped off.

And what about the innocent tourists who are unwittingly taken advantage of by casino operators? They deserve better than this – especially when you consider how much money is at stake. The gambling industry is worth billions of dollars each year, and casino scams like this one can result in millions of dollars being stolen from unsuspecting players.

So what can be done? Unfortunately, there is no easy solution as long as the authorities remain complicit in these activities. Until they take action and introduce measures to ensure a level playing field for all players – both locals and tourists – then Saint Lucia's dirty little secret will continue to tarnish its reputation as a tourist destination.

#  How to beat the Saint Lucia blackjack rigged casino

There are a few ways that you can beat the Saint Lucia blackjack rigged casino, but before we get into that, let’s take a look at how the casino is rigged in the first place.

Saint Lucia is known for its beautiful beaches and resorts, but it’s also home to some of the most crooked casinos in the world. The games are rigged so that the house always wins, and players have little chance of coming out ahead.

So how do you beat these casinos? There are a few things that you can do:

1. Play online blackjack instead of live blackjack. The online versions of these games are not rigged, so you have a better chance of winning.

2. Use a blackjack strategy chart to guide your playing decisions. This will help you to make the right choices each time and give you a better chance of winning.

3. Don’t bet too much money. If you’re only betting small amounts, the casino won’t make very much money off of you – and that’s their goal. So by betting small, you can actually increase your chances of winning.

4. Be patient. Roulette is one of the easiest games to win money on at a casino, but it also takes the most patience. The same is true for blackjack – if you wait for the right opportunity, you can come out ahead in this game too.
