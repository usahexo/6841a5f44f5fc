Whether you are looking for a last-minute getaway or planning a vacation well in advance, Carnival has amazing rates that are hard to beat. That being said, there may be times when you find a better deal on another cruise line and want to switch your reservation to that line.</p>
<p>Can you get a price alteration if you have booked a casino rate through Carnival? The answer is yes, but there are some things you need to know first. First of all, price alterations are subject to availability at the time you request them. Secondly, your original reservation must have been made at least 14 days prior to the cruise departure date.</p>
<p>If both of those criteria are met, then you can usually get the difference between the Carnival rate and the price on the other line refunded to you. You will also be responsible for any difference in fare, as well as any fees or penalties associated with making the change. In most cases, however, it is worth it to take advantage of Carnival’s great prices!</p>
<h1 id="Yes-You-Can-Get-Price-Alterations-When-Booking-A-Casino-Rate-Via-Carnival"><a href="#Yes-You-Can-Get-Price-Alterations-When-Booking-A-Casino-Rate-Via-Carnival" class="headerlink" title="Yes, You Can Get Price Alterations When Booking A Casino Rate Via Carnival!"></a>Yes, You Can Get Price Alterations When Booking A Casino Rate Via Carnival!</h1><p>If you’re looking to score a casino rate during your next cruise, don’t forget that Carnival offers price alterations! Here’s everything you need to know:</p>
<p>Your first step is to book the casino rate. Choose the stateroom and select the “Casino Rate” option. Please note that restrictions may apply.</p>
<p>If the rate drops after you’ve booked, Carnival will automatically adjust your reservation and charge you the new lower price—guaranteed! If the price increases, however, you are welcome to cancel without penalty. Simply call our friendly cruise consultants at 1-855-737-2784.</p>
<p>This complimentary service is just one more way that Carnival makes cruising easy and affordable for everyone. So what are you waiting for? Book your casino rate today!</p>
<h1 id="You-Can-Get-Price-Alterations-When-Booking-A-Casino-Rate-Via-Carnival"><a href="#You-Can-Get-Price-Alterations-When-Booking-A-Casino-Rate-Via-Carnival" class="headerlink" title="You Can Get Price Alterations When Booking A Casino Rate Via Carnival!"></a>You Can Get Price Alterations When Booking A Casino Rate Via Carnival!</h1><p>Do you want to know a mystery? Many people don’t know that they can get price alterations when reserving their casino rate with Carnival Cruise Lines. If you find that the cost of your preferred cabin decreases after you’ve reserved, Carnival Cruise Lines will give you the price difference as a refund or credit! You don’t have anything to lose by trying, so what are you waiting for?</p>
<p>Some people may think that this is too good to be true, but it’s a real policy offered by Carnival Cruise Lines. There are a few things that you should keep in mind before requesting a price alteration, however. For example, the decrease in price must be at least $25 and the decrease must be for the same cabin category and sailing date. If these conditions are met, then go ahead and contact Carnival Cruise Lines to request your price alteration.</p>
<p>It’s important to note that this policy is only valid if you reserve your casino rate through Carnival Cruise Lines. If you book through a different travel agency or directly through the cruise line, then you will not be eligible for a price alteration. Additionally, this policy is not valid for group bookings or charter sailings. So, if you’re traveling with a group or on a charter sailing, then unfortunately you won’t be able to take advantage of this offer.</p>
<p>If you’re still interested in booking a casino rate with Carnival Cruise Lines and would like to take advantage of their price alteration policy, then head over to their website and start browsing! With cabins starting at just $129 per night, there’s something for everyone!</p>
