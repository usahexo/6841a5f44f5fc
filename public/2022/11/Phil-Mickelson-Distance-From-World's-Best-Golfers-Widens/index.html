        <h1 id="Phil-Mickelson-Distance-From-World’s-Best-Golfers-Widens"><a href="#Phil-Mickelson-Distance-From-World’s-Best-Golfers-Widens" class="headerlink" title="Phil Mickelson Distance From World’s Best Golfers Widens"></a>Phil Mickelson Distance From World’s Best Golfers Widens</h1><p>One of Phil Mickelson’s primary goals is to stay sharp and be one of the best golfers in the world. It was apparent at the British Open Championship that he has a long way to go.</p>
<p>Mickelson shot an even-par 71 in the first round and is now eight strokes behind the leader, Francesco Molinari. This follows an inconsistent performance in 2018, where Mickelson had seven top-10 finishes but also missed six cuts.</p>
<p>The distance between Mickelson and the top tier of golfers has widened. In particular, Tiger Woods seems to have taken back his throne as the best golfer in the world. Woods finished first at the Valspar Championship and above Mickelson at The Arnold Palmer Invitational, The Players Championship, and The Memorial Tournament.</p>
<p>What has been hindering Mickelson’s ability to compete with these top golfers? One possible explanation is his age; Mickelson is 48 years old while Tiger Woods is only 42. However, Jack Nicklaus won 18 major championships after turning 40. Additionally, many professional golfers continue to compete at a high level well into their 50s.</p>
<p>One more plausible explanation for Mickelson’s recent struggles lies in his equipment choice. He switched to a new driver this year but later went back to his old driver after experiencing problems with the new one. This inconsistency might have caused him to lose confidence in his game.</p>
<p>Whatever the reason may be, Phil Mickelson needs to sort things out if he wants to add another major championship trophy to his collection.</p>
<h1 id="Phil-Mickelson-Trails-Field-by-Six-Strokes-After-First-Round"><a href="#Phil-Mickelson-Trails-Field-by-Six-Strokes-After-First-Round" class="headerlink" title="Phil Mickelson Trails Field by Six Strokes After First Round"></a>Phil Mickelson Trails Field by Six Strokes After First Round</h1><p>The opening round of the AT&amp;T Pebble Beach National Pro-Am saw Phil Mickelson trail the field by six strokes. This follows his withdrawal from last week’s tournament due to a hip injury. </p>
<p>The former world number two shot a one-over 73 on Thursday at the Monterey Peninsula Country Club Shore Course, which is where he is playing as he looks to defend his title. Mickelson’s opening round was highlighted by four bogeys and a single birdie. </p>
<p>While he trails the leaders, Mickelson remains upbeat about his chances of defending his title. “I don’t see how I can’t shoot six or seven under par tomorrow,” said Mickelson. </p>
<p>This optimism may come from the fact that he has won this tournament five times, including last year when he overtook Tiger Woods for first place in the final round. In order to win this year, Mickelson will need to overcome some stiff competition, including Dustin Johnson who shot a six-under 66 on Thursday and sits in first place. </p>
<p>Rounding out the top three is Jason Day who shot a five-under 67 on Thursday. The other notable names in the top 10 include Jordan Spieth (tied for 4th at 68), Brooks Koepka (tied for 4th at 68) and Rory McIlroy (tied for 7th at 69).</p>
<h1 id="Mickelson-Struggles-in-Final-Round-Falls-Further-Back"><a href="#Mickelson-Struggles-in-Final-Round-Falls-Further-Back" class="headerlink" title="Mickelson Struggles in Final Round, Falls Further Back"></a>Mickelson Struggles in Final Round, Falls Further Back</h1><p>Phil Mickelson had an up-and-down final round at the Farmers Insurance Open, shooting a 3-over 74 that left him in a tie for 11th place.</p>
<p>The struggling Mickelson never really got anything going on Sunday, recording just two birdies against five bogeys. It was his third consecutive round over par and dropped him four places in the overall standings.</p>
<p>“I didn’t play well today,” Mickelson said after the round. “I made too many mistakes.”</p>
<p>Mickelson will now turn his attention to next week’s Waste Management Phoenix Open, where he is a two-time champion. He’ll need a much better performance if he wants to contend this year, as he currently sits 27th in the FedEx Cup standings.</p>
<h1 id="Phil-Mickelson-Finishes-Third-at-Masters-10-Shots-Behind-Winner"><a href="#Phil-Mickelson-Finishes-Third-at-Masters-10-Shots-Behind-Winner" class="headerlink" title="Phil Mickelson Finishes Third at Masters, 10 Shots Behind Winner"></a>Phil Mickelson Finishes Third at Masters, 10 Shots Behind Winner</h1><p>Phil Mickelson finished in third place at the Masters Tournament on Sunday, 10 shots behind the winner, Patrick Reed. It was his best finish at the event since he finished runner-up in 2011.</p>
<p>Mickelson started the final round three shots off the lead but quickly fell out of contention with a triple bogey on the fourth hole. He birdied six of his next 12 holes to make a run at the leaders but ultimately came up short.</p>
<p>“Congrats to Patrick,” Mickelson said after the round. “He played an amazing week and I’m very happy for him.”</p>
<p>Mickelson will now turn his attention to the U.S. Open, which he won in 2013. He will be looking to become just the sixth golfer in history to win all four major championships.</p>
<h1 id="Phil-Mickelson-Falls-Out-of-Top-Ten-in-World-Golf-Rankings"><a href="#Phil-Mickelson-Falls-Out-of-Top-Ten-in-World-Golf-Rankings" class="headerlink" title="Phil Mickelson Falls Out of Top Ten in World Golf Rankings"></a>Phil Mickelson Falls Out of Top Ten in World Golf Rankings</h1><p>For the first time in over two years, Phil Mickelson is no longer a top-10 golfer in the world.</p>
<p>The former world number two fell to number 11 after finishing in a tie for 37th at the PGA Championship. The 48-year-old has now dropped out of the top 10 in the rankings for the first time since September 2015.</p>
<p>Mickelson has failed to win a tournament since the British Open last year and has seen his world ranking drop to its lowest point since he was ranked number 13 in early 1997.</p>
<p>“It’s been tough,” Mickelson said. “My results have not been what I’ve wanted for quite some time now.”</p>
<p>Mickelson is hopeful that he can turn things around, with this week’s FedEx Cup Playoffs opener - The Northern Trust - just days away.</p>
<p>“I’m still motivated and still have a lot of passion for it,” Mickelson said. “I’m excited about these next few events and looking forward to see if I can maybe get something going here.”</p>
