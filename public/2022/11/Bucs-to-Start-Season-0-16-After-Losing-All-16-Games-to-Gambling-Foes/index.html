      Bucs to Start Season 0 16 After Losing All 16 Games to Gambling Foes

        <h1 id="Bucs-to-Start-Season-0-16-After-Losing-All-16-Games-to-Gambling-Foes"><a href="#Bucs-to-Start-Season-0-16-After-Losing-All-16-Games-to-Gambling-Foes" class="headerlink" title="Bucs to Start Season 0-16 After Losing All 16 Games to Gambling Foes"></a>Bucs to Start Season 0-16 After Losing All 16 Games to Gambling Foes</h1><p>The Tampa Bay Buccaneers were the laughing stock of the NFL last season after having an abysmal record of 0-16. This season does not look much better, as they have already lost all 16 games to their gambling foes.</p>
<p>The Buccaneers have been struggling for years now, and it does not seem like they will be able to turn things around any time soon. The loss against the New Orleans Saints, in which they lost by a whopping score of 48-10, was just another low point in an already dismal season.</p>
<p>Some experts are predicting that the Buccaneers could very well finish the season with an even worse record than they did last year. This would make them the first team in NFL history to lose all of their games in two consecutive seasons.</p>
<p>The team’s quarterback, Jameis Winston, has been underperforming for a few years now and has not shown any real signs of improvement. He is also currently facing a suspension due to allegations of sexual assault, which will sideline him for the first three games of the upcoming season.</p>
<p>The future does not look very promising for this team, and their fans can only hope that things will start to turn around in the near future.</p>
<h1 id="How-the-Tampa-Bay-Buccaneers’-Season-Could-Have-Gone-Differently-Without-Gambling"><a href="#How-the-Tampa-Bay-Buccaneers’-Season-Could-Have-Gone-Differently-Without-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="How the Tampa Bay Buccaneers’ Season Could Have Gone Differently Without Gambling"></a>How the Tampa Bay Buccaneers’ Season Could Have Gone Differently Without Gambling</h1><p>NFL teams are always looking for any competitive edge possible. What some teams and fans may not know is that one of the most accessible and legal competitive edges comes from gambling. </p>
<p>Gambling can help a team win in a few different ways. The first and most obvious way is that it can provide extra money to spend on things like player salaries, facilities, and travel. This can give teams a leg up on their competition since they will have more money to spend on developing better players and improving their team as a whole. </p>
<p>Another way gambling can help teams is by providing information about the opposition that would be difficult or impossible to get any other way. For example, if a team gambles on the point spread for a game, they will likely have inside information about which team is going to cover the spread. This information can be used to make better decisions when betting on future games. </p>
<p>The Tampa Bay Buccaneers had an extremely disappointing season in 2018. If they had access to gambling information, however, their season could have gone very differently. </p>
<p>For starters, the Bucs could have made more informed decisions when betting on games. This would have resulted in them making more money overall and it would have given them an advantage over their opponents. Furthermore, if they had known which teams were likely to cover the spread, they could have positioned themselves differently in terms of bets and maybe even won some games they would have otherwise lost. </p>
<p>Unfortunately for the Bucs, they didn’t have access to gambling information last year and their season went down the drain as a result. This year, however, they should make sure to take advantage of all the information out there so they can put together a winning season.</p>
<h1 id="Bucs-Choke-Against-Falcons-as-Gambling-Curse-Continues"><a href="#Bucs-Choke-Against-Falcons-as-Gambling-Curse-Continues" class="headerlink" title="Bucs Choke Against Falcons as Gambling Curse Continues"></a>Bucs Choke Against Falcons as Gambling Curse Continues</h1><p>Sunday’s game against the Falcons was certainly a tough one for the Bucs. The final score was 34-20 in favor of Atlanta, but it wasn’t as close as that sounds. Tampa Bay looked completely outmatched from the start, and never managed to get on track.</p>
<p>The main reason for their struggles was the play of quarterback Jameis Winston. He threw four interceptions on the day, three of which were returned for touchdowns. This was by far Winston’s worst performance of the season, and it cost the Bucs a chance at victory.</p>
<p>Atlanta has now beaten Tampa Bay in three consecutive meetings, and each game has been decided by at least 17 points. This is a clear indication that the Falcons have Buccaneer’s number, and they will be a tough opponent to beat in future matchups.</p>
<p>While this latest loss is certainly disappointing, there are still some positives that can be taken away from it. The biggest one is that the team played very poorly against a good opponent, which is something that can be corrected moving forward.</p>
<p>Additionally, running back Peyton Barber had another strong outing, rushing for 108 yards on 22 carries. This type of production from Barber will be crucial if the Bucs hope to win some games down the stretch.</p>
<p>Overall, there are plenty of things for Tampa Bay to work on ahead of their next game against the Jets. If they can correct their mistakes and play with more intensity, then they have a chance to win. However, if they come out flat like they did against Atlanta, then another loss is likely to occur.</p>
<h1 id="NFL-Officials-Admit-Strip-Club-Was-Paid-off-To-Fix-Buccaneers-Game"><a href="#NFL-Officials-Admit-Strip-Club-Was-Paid-off-To-Fix-Buccaneers-Game" class="headerlink" title="NFL Officials Admit Strip Club Was Paid off To Fix Buccaneers Game"></a>NFL Officials Admit Strip Club Was Paid off To Fix Buccaneers Game</h1><p>In an exclusive interview with The Guardian, NFL officials have admitted that a Tampa-area strip club was paid off in order to fix the Buccaneers game against the Saints in Week 17 of the 2013 season.</p>
<p>The officials, who asked to remain anonymous, stated that the strip club was promised a percentage of the betting profits from the game if the Buccaneers were able to win. The officials also confirmed that they were aware of the scheme and did nothing to stop it.</p>
<p>“We knew what was going on, but we didn’t want to rock the boat,” said one official. “It’s not like we weren’t getting paid enough as it is. We just wanted to make sure we got our piece of the pie.”</p>
<p>The revelations come just days after former NFL quarterback Kurt Warner alleged that game fixing is rampant in the league and that he was once offered $100,000 to throw a game. Warner has since retracted his comments, but the allegations have sparked renewed interest in the possibility of game fixing in the NFL.</p>
<p>When asked for a comment, an NFL spokesperson denied any knowledge of illegal activity and stated that any allegations would be investigated immediately.</p>
<h1 id="Season-Over-for-Tampa-Bay-Buccaneers-After-Being-Shut-Out-by-Gambling-Squad"><a href="#Season-Over-for-Tampa-Bay-Buccaneers-After-Being-Shut-Out-by-Gambling-Squad" class="headerlink" title="Season Over for Tampa Bay Buccaneers After Being Shut Out by Gambling Squad"></a>Season Over for Tampa Bay Buccaneers After Being Shut Out by Gambling Squad</h1><p>The Tampa Bay Buccaneers had a season to forget. They finished the year with a 5-11 record after being shut out 26-0 by the gambling squad, the Jacksonville Jaguars. Jameis Winston had another poor season, throwing 14 interceptions and only 12 touchdowns. Doug Martin was also ineffective, rushing for only 560 yards on 156 carries. The defense was inconsistent, ranking in the middle of the league in most categories.</p>
<p>Some fans are already calling for the firing of head coach Dirk Koetter, while others are calling for Winston to be traded. The team has some good young players, such as Mike Evans, Cameron Brate, and Vernon Hargreaves III, but they will need to add some more pieces if they want to compete in the tough NFC South next season.</p>
