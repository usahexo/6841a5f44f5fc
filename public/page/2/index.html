        <h1 id="What-are-the-5-ways"><a href="#What-are-the-5-ways" class="headerlink" title="What are the 5 ways?"></a>What are the 5 ways?</h1><p>In the world of business, there are five ways to make money. The five ways are product, service, franchise, royalties and residual income.</p>
<p>The first way is through product sales. When a company produces a good or service and sells it to consumers, they make a profit on the sale. This is the most common way to make money in business and is how most companies operate.</p>
<p>The second way is through service provision. This involves providing a service to clients in exchange for payment. Services can be provided in person or over the Internet.</p>
<p>The third way to make money is through franchising. Franchising is when a company licenses its brand and business model to another party in order to start a new business. The party who owns the franchise pays a fee to the company for this license and then earns a share of the profits from the new business.</p>
<p>The fourth way to make money is through royalties. A company can earn royalties by licensing its intellectual property to other parties. For example, a music artist might license their songs to a movie studio for use in a film. The studio would then pay the artist a royalty each time the song is played in the film.</p>
<p>The fifth way businesses can make money is through residual income. Residual income is earned when a company collects payments for services provided over an extended period of time. For example, a company that provides Internet service might receive monthly payments from its customers for years after they sign up for the service.</p>
